## Notes

* Change the boolean to False in line 51 if you do not want to write it to a database.
* Do not forget to modify the default parameters when writing to the database.
- By default, it connects to MongoDB at your localhost, on port 27017.
- Writes the results to the database named 'offerings', all the data for all departments into the same collection, titled 'semester20161'.
- And all this is mutable.
